<h3>How do I set up my environment to help in this project</h3>

To begin contributing to this repository the main thing you will need is python 3.4 or higher.

After installing python, to start coding or testing, you'll only need the .py files, users.prc (can be empty) wich stores all the user info (username, passwprd, permission level) and a folder called PercOS_filesystem and inside it a folder called users (if it's empty the users.prc has to be empty as well).

All that stuff needed is in the **lastest release**, the only problem is that that might not be up to date, so it is only an example of how the workspace should be setup

To test PercOS (after installing python) simply do `python3 PercOS.py` while being in the same directory as the file PercOS.py
