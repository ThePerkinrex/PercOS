**PercOS** is an open source virtual machine based on python which tries to emulate a unix like OS. It's made so that it is modular and you can very easily create your own commands by adding a file to a folder. It's open source so that you can create yor own version of PercOS with diferent functionalities (in that case please share it with me in a pull request with the label **`my version`**)
